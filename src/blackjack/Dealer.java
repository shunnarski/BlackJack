package blackjack;
import java.util.*;
/*
This class simulates the moves that a dealer would make
in a real blackjack table. 

The dealer draws two cards, one is shown, the other is hidden. 
After turns are made by the players, the dealer flops their hidden cards.
If the total count of cards is >= 17, the dealer sits, and that's the end of the game. 
If the dealer's cards sum to < 17, the dealer must hit until >= 17 or the dealer busts. 


Just some notes about Inheritance, similiar to how the "this" keyword references
the current class, the "super" key word points to the parent class.
